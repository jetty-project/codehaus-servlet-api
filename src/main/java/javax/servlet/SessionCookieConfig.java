     * attribute to them. <i>HttpOnly</i> cookies are not supposed to be
     * exposed to client-side scripting code, and may therefore help
     * mitigate certain kinds of cross-site scripting attacks.

     * tracking cookie configured by this <tt>SessionCookieConfig</tt>

     * the corresponding session is using plain HTTP instead of a secure
     * protocol such as HTTPS.

     * cookie configured by this <tt>SessionCookieConfig</tt> will be marked
     * as <i>secure</i> only if the request that initiated the corresponding
